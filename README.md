# Deployer

Deployer is a simple tool created to make it easy to deploy files (mainly code) to a remote host. The main goal is to build a simple layer on top of rsync and ssh, so the user can access and update files the fastest way possible.

**Currently, this project is just a PoC. There's a lot of work to do, and for now the code on the repository is nothing but a scratch of the project.**
